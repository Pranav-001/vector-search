## Features

- **Data Retrieval:** Fetch teacher profiles and job listings from a PostgreSQL database.
- **Data Formatting:** Prepares data for vector indexing.
- **Vector Search:** Uses GCP tools to find the best teacher matches for each job.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data processing and vector search.
- **GCP (Vertex AI, GCP Vector Search)**: For vector indexing and searching.
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores teacher and job data.
